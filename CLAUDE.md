# logic-mcp

A local MCP server (Swift daemon, MCP over stdio) that gives Claude end-to-end control of Logic Pro — a "cockpit" for collaborating with an agent on production and engineering work.

## Status (as of 2026-07-08)

- **Design spec approved:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-08-logic-mcp-design.md` — read it first, it is the source of truth for architecture and scope.
- **Brainstorming is done.** Do not re-open design questions already settled in the spec.
- **Next step:** invoke the `superpowers:writing-plans` skill to produce the implementation plan. Suggested phasing: by control layer, **MCUBridge first** (self-contained, no permissions beyond MIDI, unlocks the "mix moves via chat" demo fastest), then FileGateway (analysis + MIDI round-trip), then AXDriver (structural ops), then VisionVerifier + shadow-model integration.

## Architecture in one paragraph

Logic Pro has no scripting API, so control goes through layered side doors, each behind typed MCP tools: (1) **MCUBridge** — Mackie Control emulation over virtual CoreMIDI ports; bidirectional (Logic echoes track names, fader positions, param values back), covers mixing/transport/plugin params without window focus; (2) **AXDriver** — Accessibility-tree walking + a canonical key-command set for structural ops (create track, insert plugin, routing, quantize/flex); (3) **FileGateway** — audio from the `.logicx` bundle + exported stems for DSP analysis, MIDI file round-trip; (4) **VisionVerifier** — screenshots for verification only, never as actuator. A cached **shadow project model** serves state queries. Every tool returns verified ground truth. Distribution: notarized Developer ID direct download (Accessibility rules out the Mac App Store).

## Working preferences (carried over from prior sessions)

- **No auto-commits.** Never commit during implementation; the user controls when to commit.
- **Subagent-driven development.** Use subagent execution for implementation work without asking.
- **No re-export wrapper/shim files.** Update consumer imports directly.
- **Superpowers flow.** brainstorm → spec → writing-plans → subagent execution with review checkpoints. Specs/plans live in `docs/superpowers/`.
- During brainstorming, skip the browser visual companion — text is fine.
